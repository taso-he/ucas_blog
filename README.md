# Overview

This is the repository for the data and code behind the analysis for my TASO blog ["The results are in: What can UCAS data tell us about inequalities in higher education?"](https://taso.org.uk/news-item/the-results-are-in-what-can-ucas-data-tell-us-about-inequalities-in-higher-education/)

This repository provides all the data and code used to create the charts featured in the article. 

# Contents 

-  Data: The data, downloaded from [UCAS statistical releases](https://www.ucas.com/data-and-analysis/undergraduate-statistics-and-reports/statistical-releases-daily-clearing-analysis-2024). The UCAS data will update each weekday between 15 and 30 August 2024 and on day 28. Here, we use the data for 20 August, the latest available release at the time of publication. The data from results day is also in this repository.
-  Code: The code used to conduct the analysis. With a few minor tweaks (mainly renaming the relevant variable), this code can be used to analyse any of the entry rates data (i.e. here we look at the entry rates by IMD, but this code could be used to look at entry rates by POLAR4, TUNDRA, UK region etc.)
-  Figures: The image files for the charts are saved here. Note that the font used will need to be installed on your computer to recreate the charts exactly, otherwise R's default font Arial will be used.
